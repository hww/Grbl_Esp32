The coil winder based on [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32). 

Added:

- _coilwinder_ machine with settings for two step motors with 6600 drivers.

The _coilgen_ folder cotains a python script for generating gcode from a coil's params. The file generated by the _coilgen_ contains a wire's turn number and layer number as gcode a comment. This comment will be displayed on OLED display. 

In general i do not like _grbl_ but it saved my time and i can make my coils quicker now.
