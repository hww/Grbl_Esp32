# CoilWinder based on grbl for ESP32

The coil winder machine based on [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32) firmware. 

Added to GRBL:

- The _coilwinder.h_ machine configuration with settings for two step motors with 6600 drivers. 

- The _Report.cpp_ file is modifyed and now contains (a bit clucky) driver for SSD1306 OLED display. The display reports current CNC status (see image below).

The _coilgen_ folder contains the _Python_ script for generating gcode from a coil's params. The file generated by the _coilgen_ contains a wire's turn number and layer number as gcode a comment. This comment will be displayed on OLED display. 

In general i do not like _grbl_ but it saved my time and i can make my coils quicker now.
